# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a healthcare image analysis system that processes MRI images through a multi-stage AI pipeline. The system automatically processes uploaded MRI images through segmentation, image-to-text conversion, and LLM-enhanced analysis to generate comprehensive medical reports. The system leverages AWS services including SageMaker, Bedrock, OpenSearch, and CI/CD pipeline tools (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy) for a complete MLOps solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to upload MRI images through a web interface, so that I can automatically generate detailed medical analysis reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the system THEN the system SHALL present a Streamlit-based web interface
2. WHEN a user uploads an MRI image file THEN the system SHALL store the file in an S3 bucket
3. WHEN an MRI image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and size
4. IF the uploaded file is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want MRI images to be automatically processed when uploaded, so that the analysis pipeline runs without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MRI image file is uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger the segmentation model
2. WHEN the S3 upload event occurs THEN the system SHALL initiate the processing workflow within 30 seconds
3. IF the automatic trigger fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry the process
4. WHEN the processing starts THEN the system SHALL update the job status in the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a medical researcher, I want MRI images to be segmented accurately, so that I can identify specific anatomical structures for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MRI image enters the pipeline THEN the system SHALL process it using a SageMaker-hosted segmentation model
2. WHEN segmentation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate segmented image outputs
3. WHEN segmentation processing occurs THEN the system SHALL complete within 5 minutes for standard MRI images
4. IF segmentation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want segmented images to be converted to descriptive text, so that I can understand the visual findings in written form.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN segmentation is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically process the result with a Vision-Language Model (VLM)
2. WHEN the VLM processes the image THEN the system SHALL generate descriptive text about the medical findings
3. WHEN image-to-text conversion occurs THEN the system SHALL use a HuggingFace-hosted VLM model
4. IF the VLM processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry once and log any persistent failures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want the generated text to be enhanced with medical expertise, so that I receive comprehensive and accurate medical insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image-to-text conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL process the text using Bedrock LLM with RAG
2. WHEN RAG processing occurs THEN the system SHALL query OpenSearch for relevant medical knowledge
3. WHEN LLM enhancement is applied THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive medical report
4. WHEN the final report is generated THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores and source references

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a healthcare administrator, I want all analysis results to be stored securely, so that I can retrieve and review past analyses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis pipeline completes THEN the system SHALL store all results in a secure database
2. WHEN storing results THEN the system SHALL include original image metadata, processing timestamps, and analysis outputs
3. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL comply with healthcare data privacy regulations
4. IF database storage fails THEN the system SHALL retry and maintain data integrity

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to be deployed and updated automatically, so that I can maintain consistent deployments across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are committed THEN CodePipeline SHALL automatically trigger the CI/CD process
2. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN CodeBuild SHALL execute tests and build artifacts
3. WHEN build is successful THEN CodeDeploy SHALL deploy to the target environment
4. IF any pipeline stage fails THEN the system SHALL halt deployment and notify the team

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to monitor the health and performance of all system components, so that I can ensure reliable operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide health checks for all AWS services
2. WHEN processing occurs THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and processing times
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and notifications
4. WHEN monitoring data is collected THEN it SHALL be available through CloudWatch dashboards

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all data and communications to be encrypted, so that patient data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored in S3 THEN it SHALL be encrypted at rest
2. WHEN data is transmitted between services THEN it SHALL be encrypted in transit
3. WHEN users access the system THEN they SHALL authenticate using secure methods
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use proper IAM roles and policies

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to view processing status and results, so that I can track the progress of my image analyses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an image THEN the system SHALL provide a unique job ID for tracking
2. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL display current status and estimated completion time
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL notify the user and display results
4. WHEN viewing results THEN the user SHALL be able to download reports and processed images
